# GoConnect Web App

## Project description

GoConnect is an app which encourages people to meet and talk about different topics in real life in real time. It is meant to foster societal discourse and out-of-the-bubble connections.

It enables users to view other users nearby (within 100 m) who are open to talk about a certain topic or in general.
GoConnect can be utilized in contexts such as universities, museums, large parties, events, parks, or public transport. The app will be used when users want to effortlessly gain a new perspective through a new connection with someone nearby.

This is the WebApp version built with Vue.js.
